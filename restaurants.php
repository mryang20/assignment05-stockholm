		<h1>Fattoush / Roppongi / Panini</h1>

			<p>A small three-restaurant food court in a central location between the Gallerian shopping center and the NK department store. Fattoush has tasty Lebanese fast food, Roppongi has decent sushi, and Panini offers a selection of sandwiches and salads.</p>

		<h1>Örtagården</h1>
			<p>Located on the top floor of the Östermalmshallen food market, Örtagården serves a sumptuous vegetarian buffet with hot and cold vegetarian dishes at a decent price. There is also a "back pocket" serving meat dishes.</p>

		<h1>Simons Skafferi No12</h1>
			<p>Swedish dishes with focus on local and organic ingredients in season, so the menu changes quite often. The employees are very professional and the wine to food pairings are excellent. Open both for lunch and dinner.</p>

		<h1>Operabaren and Bakfickan</h1>

			<p>Two restaurants in the Royal Opera house, sharing the same menu. Much more laidback, and considerably less expensive than the formal fine dining restaurant Operakällaren and the celebrity-obsessed nightclub Café Opera in the same building. Operabaren and Bakfickan specialise in traditional Swedish cuisine. The rustique "back pocket" Bakfickan is slightly cheaper, but does not allow reservations.</p>

		<h1>Café Opera and Operakällaren</h1>

			<p>Situated in the building of the Royal Opera, Café Opera has for long been the place if you want to be seen with celebrities. Offers good food and drinks. Dress code applies. In the same building you'll find a beautiful dining room of the formal and extremely expensive Operakällaren.</p>
