		<h1>Drottninggatan</h1>

			<p>A pedestrianised street that starts at the Riksbron bridge to Gamla Stan and continues north up to the Observatorielunden park. The section south of the Sergels torg square is a typical tourist trap, dominated by stores selling tourist souvenirs and cheap clothes, and bland and bleak restaurants. Between Sergels Torg and Kungsgatan you will find the Åhléns and PUB department stores, as well as flagship stores for some national and international clothing chains. North of Kungsgatan, there are more cafés, restaurants and smaller stores.</p>

		<h1>Åhléns City</h1>

			<p>A large department store in a central location, with a good selection of designer clothing brands. Also beauty products, kitchenware, interior design, records and DVDs, as well as everything else you would expect from a major department store.</p>

		<h1>PUB</h1>

			<p>A classic Stockholm department store founded in 1882. Following something of an identity crisis in recent years, PUB is currently undergoing a major redesign, with the intention of rebranding itself as a store for young fashion and popular culture. A few new street wear shops on the ground floor is a sign of this.</p>

		<h1>Gallerian</h1>
			<p>Stockholm's oldest shopping mall, where you can find many of Sweden’s major mainstream fashion chains as well as some foreign brands such as Topshop/Topman, French Connection, Esprit and United Colors of Benetton.</p>

		<h1>Sturegallerian</h1>
			<p>Opened in 1989, Sturegallerian is an upmarket shopping center in central Stockholm, with stores carrying a good selection of exclusive brands. Also the home of the upmarket restaurants Sturehof and Tures and the nightclub Sturecompagniet.</p>
