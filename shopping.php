		<h1>Drottninggatan</h1>

			<p>A pedestrianised street that starts at the Riksbron bridge to Gamla Stan and continues north up to the Observatorielunden park. The section south of the Sergels torg square is a typical tourist trap, dominated by stores selling tourist souvenirs and cheap clothes, and bland and bleak restaurants. Between Sergels Torg and Kungsgatan you will find the Åhléns and PUB department stores, as well as flagship stores for some national and international clothing chains. </p>

Following something of an identity crisis in recent years, PUB is currently undergoing a major redesign, with the intention of rebranding itself as a store for young fashion and popular culture. A few new street wear shops on the ground floor is a sign of this.</p>
